turkeyvulture
==============

To get started:

1) install the other requirements:

    pip install -r experimental/turkeyvulture/requirements.txt

2) build_index.py needs to use ntlk's stopwords, which annoyingly requires downloading the english corpus they're derived from:

    python
    import nltk
    nltk.download()

Then you just download all, or if less lazy, you can selectively download.

Then build the index:

    cd experimental/turkeyvulture
    python build_index.py ../../site/media/js/turkeyvulture/index

NOTE:
To rebuild the templates, you need jsonjinja:

    git clone https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jsonjinja.git
    cd jsonjinja
    python setup.py install

Then, to rebuild the templates:

    cd experimental/turkeyvulture
    python js.py > ../../site/media/js/turkeyvulture/templates.js
